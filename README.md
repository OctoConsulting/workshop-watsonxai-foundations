# Technical Hands-On Labs: Foundations of watsonx.ai 

**Note** - This workshop was recently updated to use the [GA instance of watsonx.ai](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/wx) as well as the new [Foundation Models](https://ibm.github.io/watson-machine-learning-sdk/foundation_models.html) module within the [Watson Machine Learning Python SDK](https://pypi.org/project/ibm-watson-machine-learning/). The previous version was based on the "workbench" BAM environment, which will soon be sunset.

Completing these technical hands-on labs will take roughly 12 hours plus another 2-3 hours to complete the Apply Lessons Learned labs. You should have completed the [attendee pre-requisites](attendee-prerequisites.md) prior to starting.
