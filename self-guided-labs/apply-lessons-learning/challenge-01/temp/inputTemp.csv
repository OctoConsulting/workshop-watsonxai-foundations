email contacted discovers support team via discover mobile app connected support agent named location stated check processed one day received initial email take day received know letter initial email sent said business day im sure sorry stated still received day contact responded asking quoted business day initial email replied usually take business day take day day stated initial email chat sat idle got disconnected contacted reached agent via app shortly disconnected stated discover today forward information investigation resend security deposit never received information would sent via apps secure inbox platform via email transferred another support agent reached stated check usually take business day arrive business day figure slightly inconsistent business day quoted elsewhere concern relatively insignificant stated discover must allow day resending check account possible mailing delay statement indicated day initial processing date per discover would able resend check word statement led reasonable conclusion check would resent mailed later shown incorrect later support agent would go detail lengthy investigation process required mark check would resent investigation complete certainly could resent suggested asked confirm mailing address transferred another agent reached stated mailing address typed matched one file stated check requested contradicted indicated said havent received within day date request new check reissued one stopped led reasonable conclusion new check would requested prior statement indicated check could mailed mark mention intervening investigation process also failed mention investigation process without knowledge process took requested mean resent mailed may unaware intervening investigation process assumed already informed process intended word requested indicate launch investigation process concluded would lead check getting mailed thus conversation led believe check would either reality would later discover would point investigation would launched check would mailed contacted discover via app connected day since check first wanted update check resent day stated sent information department arrange deposit resent requested deposited checking account file statement led believe mark discover would initiate direct deposit checking account lieu physical mailed check asked long would take see fund account responded would need review information old check befor e resent day first time heard process phrasing indicate would significant amount time made reasonable conclusion meant say direct deposit would initiated business day mark meaning would see fund bank account hindsight broken english made ask clarification confirm meant direct deposit would initiated mark rather would begin review information contacted support via app confirm direct deposit initiated reached utah stated set investigation security deposit mailed take day statement extremely vague wasnt sure whether meant investigation would take day investigation would take day mark check would take day arrive mailed conclusion investigation process later conversation discovered none assumption correct conversation continued picking previous conversation asked mentioned second check getting mailed previously stated would receiving via direct deposit replied sorry information received previously know must frustrating unfortunately able direct deposit security deposit return check must mailed thus given incorrect information furthermore requested deposited checking account file claimed responsible department would told possible thus either never submitted request submitted informed possible failed notify informed support time instead five day later proactively contact also stated department check must first research first check cashed reissue new check take business day first genuine mention investigation lengthy process rather quick somehow investigation process mentioned prior support agent mind review process begun concluded business day later check stated check reissued review process take additional day check arrive previous support agent indicated mailing time would anywhere business day conservative factoring potential gap date issued date mailed previous agent indicated would receive check mailbox within business day yet another example contradictory information provided support stated submit new check request previously day passed im happy take care since mark either incorrect prior conversation point process commenced even genuinely believed mark reached commenced investigation without needing proactively contact zero accountability nothing happens process unless hold hand like child tell without constant prodding case would inevitably get lost discovers support staff asked confirm address request new check finally submitted pending review process responded explaining upset entire ordeal responded send initial check knew check mailed also known mark would reached somehow failed initiate review process conversation despite knowing mark reached contradicts assertion mark reached time prior conversation state check arrive later claim seems following maximum mailout time suggesting new check getting mailed today contradicts earlier assertion review process maximum business day would need conducted check mailed prior agent contradicted somehow managed contradict point still unclear whether receive check later later factoring maximum business day investigation process supposedly initiated contact support via app seeking status update since confident actually initiated request reach delaware asks referring check requested sent back responds certainly understand concern check sent back implies second check already mailed already passed review process reiterates arrive later maximum window mind implying check mailed either review process took le day unlikely given maximum two week check mailed day requested ignorantly parroting rule skimming past conversation ignoring lengthy review period asked clarification despite implying check mailed contradicts stating review process ongoing discover find first check wasnt cashed theyll send another check take bit time investigation since review process began today would two business day maximum day investigation contact support via app seeking update since business day review process indeed began investigation given track record lacking accountability wanted confirm review process begun reach delaware say see check requested contradicts assertion check requested however state delivery time could take day mailed expect new check within calendar day given two aforesaid statement seems implying check mailed contradicting claim request submitted optimistically believe point check indeed requested review process also began day review process ended quickly check mailed simply conflating requested mailed respond saying review process ended check also mailed day reply yes mailed despite ashleys unequivocal statement check mailed contacted support via app reached stated previous check stopped team review check sent information issue new check please allow day delivery receive please let u know seems implying request new check submitted instead check actually getting mailed contradicting quoting maximum delivery window considering established rule implies check wasnt mailed another example agent contradicting contact support via app seeking update reach state check sent please allow day receive stating wasnt sent directly contradicts implied mailed outright stated mailed transferred another agent transferred utah state check resent contradicting lining claim asked stated check sent week prior dismisses claim stating discrepancy vague excuse may concocted noticed spoke saw check mailed two day later hence discrepancy however doesnt make sense since simply confirming check mailed prior agent action taken either crafted discrepancy lie place real explanation failed check mailed wasnt mailed prodding prompted check mailed latter case thus lying stated mailed indeed handled went depth explaining conversation state check mailed state sorry incorrect information provided show check mailed asks confirm mailing address recent claim day ago point abundantly clear receiving check cycling discovers vacuous support agent wont anything change find hard believe discovers staff incompetent concerned may story given immense financial strain put consumer financial firm discover ongoing pandemic fearful could victim form impropriety remain optimistic case
