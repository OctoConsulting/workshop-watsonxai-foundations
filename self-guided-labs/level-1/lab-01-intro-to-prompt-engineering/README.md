# Lab 1 : Introduction to Prompt Engineering

### watsonx.ai Environments
For self-study and customer demos, when able, the watsonx.ai GA environment should be used.  The GA environment has a limited # of tokens so you would quickly use all of them during this workshop. 

So use teh [Tech Preview environment](https://workbench.res.ibm.com/) for this workshop. The BAM environment should not be used as it includes non-GA (non-generally available) models that may never be GA'd plus it has fewer compute resources than the Tech Preview.

### Complete the following exercises
1. [Basics of Prompt Engineering](./prompt-engineering/prompt-engineering-basics.md)
2. [Creating prompts in watsonX.ai's Prompt Builder](./prompt-engineering/prompt-engineering-exercises.md)
3. [Creating prompts with content](./prompt-engineering/prompt-with-content-exercises.md)

**NOTE:** This lab is based off a [workshop from EMEA on watsonx.ai](EMEA Lab: https://github.ibm.com/ClientEngineering/generative-ai-emea/blob/main/instructions/prompt-engineering.md)
