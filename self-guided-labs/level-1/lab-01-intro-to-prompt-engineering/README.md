### watsonx.ai Environments
For self-study and customer demos, when able, the watsonx.ai GA environment should be used.  Be mindful of token limits in the GA environment--they vary depending on [pricing tier](https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-data/pricing).

### Complete the following exercises
1. [Basics of Prompt Engineering](./prompt-engineering/prompt-engineering-basics.md)
2. [Creating prompts in watsonx.ai's Prompt Builder](./prompt-engineering/prompt-engineering-exercises.md)
3. [Creating prompts with content](./prompt-engineering/prompt-with-content-exercises.md)
