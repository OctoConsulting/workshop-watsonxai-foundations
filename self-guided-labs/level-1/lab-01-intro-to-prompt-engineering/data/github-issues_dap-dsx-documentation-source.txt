Title: Remove some getting started tutorials
Description:
Rationale: theres a lot of overlap between the getting started and the DF tutorials. but while there's a lot of overlap, the getting started tutorials are simple whereas the df tutorials are not simple at all. ### Covered in DF tutorials in a different way - Refine data - used to be part of the DR doc, and then was moved to getting started. covers a lot more than the DF tutorial - Analyze data in a Jupyter notebook - covers creating a notebook, adding a data asset, and editing a notebook. we don't cover these basic things in the DF tutorials. ### Not covered in DF tutorials - Tell a story with a dashboard - Build and deploy a machine learning model with AutoAI - Build and deploy a machine learning model with SPSS Modeler - Build, run, and deploy a Decision Optimization model ### Covered in DF tutorials, but getting started tutorials have lots of views - Build and deploy a machine learning model in a Jupyter notebook - this uses a sample notebook, and is pretty clear cut (as opposed to the AI governance tutorials which also include model inventory and WOS) - Transform data - this is more popular than I would have thought. it's a pretty basic DataStage flow, but the Integrate data DF tutorial is also very easy to follow. ### Page views from May 1, 2022 to Feb 24, 2023 ! ## Actions ### Remove these tutorials - [ ] Curate data - [ ] Protect data - this is also in the CPD on-prem docs - [ ] Virtualize data ### Redirect to these tutorials | Getting started tutorial | Df tutorial | | ---- |---- | | Curate data ( | Curate high quality data ( | | Protect data ( | Protect your data ( | | Virtualize data ( | Virtualize external data ( | ### Consolidate these tutorials | Getting started tutorial | Doc tutorial | | ---- |---- | | Build and deploy a machine learning model with AutoAI ( | AutoAI tutorial ( | ### Writers affected by these changes | Writer | Service/Tool | | ---- |---- | | Julie Forgo | AutoAI | | Michelle Betbadal | Metadata import (Curate) | | Iris Glck | Mask data (Protect) | | Trish Smith | Watson Query |


Title: Update documentation for "restricted credentials" feature. (CPD)
Description:
"restricted credentials" feature = Prevent users from retrieving decrypted credentials. Turns out this feature does NOT require Flight. Friday, February 24, thread in Common connectivity: Services can support restricted credentials by one of two ways: 1. Independent of Flight = Data Refinery 2. The service supports Flight. (Right now only Notebooks) <-- as of 4.6.1 Maybe put the supported services in a separate topic? Check what's in the UI text. Data Refinery can support restricted credentials without Flight. Other services too in future? Putting label as 4.7, but probably should address this sooner. This issue is for CPD only. Support in CPDaaS will differ. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- Related: CD issues: -- -- -- Previous Development and UX issues: -- wdp-gov/tracker#89216 -- dap/dap-planning#26805 (comment) <-- Has design. -- dap/dap-planning#25857 -- dap/dap-planning#25216 -- dap/dap-planning#24586

Title: [WML][CP4D][Cloud] Update the topics that refer to cpdctl to make them more useful.
Description:
Update the deployment-related topics that refer to `cpdctl` to make them more useful. Check with the dev team for details. Example of a topic that needs to be updated:


Title: [WKC] Catalogs: test all procedures and videos
Description:
There have been a number of changes in catalogs recently that are not reflected in the docs. For example, to download an asset, you now have to go to the **Asset** page of a data asset and click the download icon. Also, business terms and data classes that are assigned to columns are trickier to add or edit and we should document that. Look at each topic under Catalog assets and update versus the UI. Check the videos and if they need to be updated, open Video issues for Sharyn.


Title: Improve AppID integration documentation with screenshots and/or verification steps
Description:
Customer support ticket exposed some issues with the Beta APPid support in CPDaaS. Maybe a short video and/or screenshot showing which service provider fields are import to CP4DaaS. e.g. pick a well known provider as an example so that at least customers can google/research based on that known provider.


Title: [CPDaaS] Improve docs for scheduling jobs regarding how API key works
Description:
Customer is requesting documention about how the API keys work for scheduling jobs. See: Summary is: The customer did more testing and the problem occurs because another user initially created the schedule. Weve been playing with the scheduled jobs and it seems that when user1 creates a new job, or edits an existing job (which is currently failing) then these scheduled jobs are starting and running correctly. However, if user2 then tries to edit these jobs again then the jobs do not run. Therefore, it seems that only jobs created and/or edited by user1 will successfully start and run. The testing we have undertaken today and the outcomes are: TEST 1 user1 edits a failing job to modify the job and saves scheduled job > JOB STARTS & RUNS SUCCESSFULLY user2 then edits this job to modify the job and saves scheduled job > JOB DOES NOT START TEST 2 user1 creates a new job and sets the schedule details and saves scheduled job > JOB STARTS & RUNS SUCCESSFULLY user2 then edits this job to modify the job and saves scheduled job > JOB DOES NOT START **I cannot locate in the documentation where schedules are mentioned with respect to the generated API key. Note: Both users can schedule jobs albeit only user1's schedule will run due to him owning the API key. Given the API key is system generated, is there documentation which describes what to do? TIA.**

The topic has been published without a video in the CPD 4.5.3 release. There will be some changes to terminology for 4.6, but the overall process should be close to the same.


Title: [WKC]: Improve quality of `edit-asset` topic

Title: [WKC] Custom relationships between assets and artifacts
Description:
Aha: Github: As a Data steward, I can create new relationships between catalog assets and additional governance artifacts, such as policies, governance rules, reference data etc. These can include additional relationships with business terms and classifications that are beyond term or classification assignments.


Title: Configure a 360-degree view tutorial should use connected data
Description:
Feedback from expert labs Most customers use connected data, so tutorials should too. Update the Customer 360 tutorials to use the Db2 connection instead of CSV files. This is dependent on the Match 360 service supporting connected data.
