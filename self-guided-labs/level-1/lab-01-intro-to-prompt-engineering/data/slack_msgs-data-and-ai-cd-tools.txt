Text: Hello! I have an advice/best practices question for WFM builds to IBM Docs with mostly MD files. I am working on a relatively new product (Unreal Data), previously only delivered as PDF. Most of the source files are in MD, though potentially not all in the future (I don't know yet). Currently, I have a test WFM instance working without problems to create an IBM Docs test URL, using a DITAMAP as the "toc" file. I have seen questions about using a summary.MD file (listed as summary.html in the WFM Docs Manager page for the "toc") for builds with MD files. Does anyone have any advice/best practices/etc. about using a DITAMAP as the "toc" files versus using a summary.MD file as the "toc" file for an IBM Docs instance that is mostly MD files (but may not always be just MD files)? Thanks in advance for any thoughts!!

Text: How is everyone doing with configuring their HSK with Github? See this thread in the channel regarding "I think there some issues running from the VS code integration as it asks for a PIN and it's non-interactive and doesn't get it. There's an entry in the FAQ for using ssh-agent, which will allow you to stash the key securely in memory for a while (but the key file is still nowhere on your disk)" :

Text: Looks like it's happening again... My commits today to 'svc-db2' and 'svc-db2w' in CPD *4.6_test* this time were successfully updated in GHE, but WFM was not detecting them. The new content eventually got built by what I assume is a scheduled "build all services" run in WFM, but not by my check-ins since 09:58 EST today. :disappointed:

Reactions:
Text: Following up on a couple broken link report issues so I can give the status our team meeting on Monday: How's it going with determining why reports on the same content on different servers don't match? It's troubling that we clear out all our broken links on the Test server before publishing, but when the report is run on the published content, broken links are found. Is there any ETA on when we'll be able to run a report at will? I remember there was some discussion about adding a build button to the report GUI.
