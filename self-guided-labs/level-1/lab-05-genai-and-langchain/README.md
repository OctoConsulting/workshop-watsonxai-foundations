# Lab 5: LangChain and IBM's GenAI Python Library

### Introduction
[LangChain](https://docs.langchain.com/docs/) is a popular framework for developing applications powered by LLMs. The LangChain team's goal is to make connecting multiple calls between LLMs easier to code while adding functionality for templates, input/output parsing, history management, agents and integrating the models with external APIs.  If you know of LangChain competitors to recommend, please let the Boot Camp leads know.

### Warning: Alpha Release of the IBM GenAI + LangChain Plugin
The Watsonx.ai development team notified us that integration with LangChain is an Alpha release.  The current LangChain plugin for IBM GenAI works, but LangChain is highly tailored for use with OpenAI so some features may not work.

### Get Started
Launch the ["Using LangChain with IBM GenAI" notebook](ibm-genai-and-langchain.ipynb) to learn more.
