    "In this lab, we will apply our new knowledge to a real-world use case as we continue learning about best practices related to prompt coding. Using the [Watson Machine learning Python SDK](https://ibm.github.io/watson-machine-learning-sdk/) to programmatically interact with watsonx.ai, we will use prompt templating techniques provided by the [LangChain Python library](https://python.langchain.com/) to streamline our interactions with the language model and maximize its potential.\n",

You can even leverage prompt templates specific to few-shot prompting, as you will see below."

    "\n",
    "The [PromptTemplate class](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/model_io/prompts/prompt_templates/) in the [LangChain Python library](https://python.langchain.com/docs/get_started/introduction) provides a flexible approach to creating prompts from structured templates.  We will use the PromptTemplate class to simplify creation of our few shot prompts for XYZ Retail.\n",
    "\n",
    "XYZ Retail has provided you their customer's data in .csv format. To generate prompts for each customer, you will need to transform the prompt that you engineered in Prompt Builder into a more useful programmatic format. Using the PromptTemplate class, you can easily substitute customer data to generate one or multiple prompts.\n",
    "\n",
    "The PromptTemplate class defines a schema where variables to replace are placed inside curly braces \"{}\". In Python parlance, it's simply using \"f-strings\" under the hood. These curly braces serve as a placeholder for the actual data that will be substituted into the template.\n",
