# Lab 09 - Applying what you've learned

### Congratulations!
You've just completed the easy part of the Watsonx.ai Boot Camp.  Now the challenge begins.

To complete the Boot Camp, we have provided a [notebook using generative AI to classify text in the financial services domain](./appying-lessons-learned.ipynb). Read through the notebook to understand how it approached the challenge of classifying text.  Your mission is to rewrite the notebook to achieve a higher accuracy by applying what you've learning in the Boot Camp:

- Refactor this notebook to use the IBM GenAI Python library's Prompt Patterns functionality.
- Implement a better few-shot learning technique to improve model accuracy.

Now, open the [final lab notebook](./appying-lessons-learned.ipynb) to get started. How much can you improve model performance?

### Finished?
Submit your completed notebooks to Anthony Stevens at apsteven@us.ibm.com.
