# Challenge 1 - Applying what you've learned

### Congratulations!
You've just completed the easy part of the Watsonx.ai Boot Camp.  Now the challenge begins.

To complete the foundations of watsonx.ai technical series, we have provided a [notebook using generative AI to classify text in news articles](./news-article-classification.ipynb). Read through the notebook to understand how it approached the challenge of classifying text.  Your mission is to rewrite the notebook by applying your new skills in prompt engineering to achieve a higher accuracy (already a high 90+%):

**Few Ideas?**
- Use the LangChain Python library's Prompt Template functionality?
- Implement a better few-shot learning technique to improve model accuracy?
- Perhaps be a rebel and show that a standard ML model performs better?

Now, [open the Challenge 1 notebook](./news-article-classification.ipynb) to get started. How much can you improve model performance?

### Finished?
Submit your completed notebooks to Anthony Stevens at apsteven@us.ibm.com.
