# Challenge 2 - SEC 10K Search Using LangChain and Streamlit 

### Congratulations!
You've made it this far and are still eager for more challenges?  Well we have another challenge, and it's somewhat open-ended.

Take everything you've learned and do something creative with it by enhanicng this streamlit UI that allows you to search through SEC 10Ks.  Only a subset of SEC 10K files (text plus embeddings) are provided in this repository due to file size. You can [download the complete SEC 10K dataset]() if you want to explore more complex implementations.

## Launch the demo app
1. Open your terminal or console window
2. cd into this Challenge's base directory
3. Copy your .env file into the folder
4. Execute the app by running the command: `streamlit run app.py`

## Applying what you've learned
The demo app provides a set of example questions to highlight the customer use case.  What can you do to improve this demo?
- Improve model parameters to achieve better summaries
- Enhance the UI to provide more useful functionality
- ...

## Submit your updated app
We are excited to view what you create.  Please send your updated Streamlit app to apsteven@us.ibm.com.  Thanks for going above and beyond!
