# Lab 10: Extra Credit

### Congratulations!
You've made it this far and are still eager for more challenges?  Well we have one last challenge, and it's somewhat open-ended.

Take everything you've learned and do something creative with it.  But build a demo UI using Streamlit for your show-n-tell.  In case you forget where the link is to the [Watsonx.ai Demo in Streamlit](./self-guided-labs/level-1/lab-07-watsonxai-demo-with-streamlit), there it is.

We are excited to view what you create.  Please send your Streamlit app to apsteven@us.ibm.com.  Thanks for going above and beyond!
